<h2>A different approach</h2>
<h3>Complete solution</h3>
<p>
DataBallet provides a streamlined web server, request handlers for static content or dynamic web applications, and access to a high-throughput multi-dimensional array database engine.
</p>
<p>
Sensible defaults are included for the database engine, but everything can be customized to your needs, especially if your database already exist.
</p>
<h3>Secure</h3>
<p>
Thanks to its underlying engine, DataBallet is immune to SQL injection.  Depending on your needs, you can also use database encryption, data-replication, and journaling.
</p>
<p>
Whether you are building a simple web page or a critical web application that needs to support your business continuity plan, DataBallet will help you achieve your goals.
</p>
<h3>Powerful</h3>
<p>
DataBallet is powered by <a href="http://fis-gtm.com/">GT.M</a>, which is widely used in the health care and financial services industries.  You can sleep peacefully knowing that your data is safe and your service is accessible.
</p>
<p>
The integration of all three layers (server, framework, and database) allow for a more streamlined offering with reduced overhead.  This allow you to focus only on your web page or application and leave the tools alone.
